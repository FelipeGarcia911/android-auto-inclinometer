# GR Offroad Meter

Welcome to GR Offroad Meter! This is an Android application designed to serve as a digital inclinometer, ideal for off-road and 4x4 driving enthusiasts. The application provides real-time readings of the vehicle's pitch and roll angles.

> **Developer's Note:** This is a personal project developed to explore and test the capabilities of the **Google Gemini CLI** and the **Vibe Coding** concept. It is a playground for experimenting with AI-assisted development in a command-line environment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Measurement:** Displays the vehicle's pitch and roll angles.
- **Visual Interface:** A clear and easy-to-read user interface that simulates a physical inclinometer.
- **Android Auto Support:** A dedicated module (`car`) for integration with Android Auto-compatible vehicle systems.
- **Calibration:** Functionality to calibrate the inclinometer's "zero point" based on the device's position in the vehicle.
- **Orientation Lock:** Allows the user to lock the screen orientation to portrait or landscape for a stable display.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into the following Gradle modules:

- **`:app`**: The main module containing the Android application for phones and tablets.
- **`:car`**: Module for Android Auto functionality, providing an adapted interface for the vehicle's screen.
- **`:common`**: A library module containing shared business logic, such as sensor calculations and data models, used by the `:app` and `:car` modules.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Language:** [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Use Cases
- **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
- **Build Tool:** Gradle with Kotlin DSL
- **Dependency Management:** Gradle Version Catalog (`libs.versions.toml`)
